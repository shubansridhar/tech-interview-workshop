# Technical Interview Workshop

### Instructions

Below are the instructions for this assignment. Your repository should automatically be reflected in the GitHub Classroom assignment.

1. Find a partner.
2. Select one person to be the interviewer and the other to be the interviewee. 
3. The interviewer will select a random problem from the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) list.
4. The interviewee will complete the code for the problem. Please complete the program as you would in an actual interview setting, aiming to come up with the most efficient solution and using think aloud protocols to explain your problem-solving strategy and thought process.
5. The interviewer will provide feedback on the code and think aloud communication following the mock interview. Please be honest and provide constructive feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your partner. Based on their performance, would you hire them?
6. The completed code from your mock interview should be committed and pushed to your repository in the Technical Interview Workshop activity. Please also modify the README.md file to add the required details.
7. Switch roles and repeat.
8. Complete the [post-survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0smF8S_8LIQJaGzKjYrnEpfVRCvnz8LHLE0tg5IuqA8QQMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**Your grade will be determined by the completed repository and survey, _not_ the quality of your code/feedback. Each student should complete the post-survey and create an individual repository from their turn as the interviewee.**

**Due:** 

* Wednesday (9/4)
* Please submit whatever code you complete in class for your repository before the end of class, and complete the survey before midnight.

* **Your name and PID**: Shuban Sridhar shubansridhar

* **Your partner's name and PID:** Jett Morrow jettmorrow

* **Link to selected coding challenge:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/

* **Summary of partner's interview feedback:** My partner told me to slow down and explain each step of my thinking process as I continue to code. A few times I would write code without saying much and in an interview that would probably not me ideal. Although the solution was correct, the steps of developing that solution need to be expressed more clearly.
